    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    
    <p>
        My name is Kathryne Bagaybagayan, and I'm taking this class to improve my understanding with the Adobe Creative Suite to progress towards the illustration side of design. My career goal is to become a digital illustrator and create concept/character designs for game companies. I chose to pursue illuatration, because I really love to draw and create images to inspire those who are just starting like I was when I was small.
