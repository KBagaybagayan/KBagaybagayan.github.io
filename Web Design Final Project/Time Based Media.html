    <h1> Why Flash? </h1>
        
<p>
    In the sprirt of the fall season I did a Halloween animation. Keeping my crocodile idea from the previous project I created this very cute animation. Sadly like I said in my Illustrator page I had a very hard time with flash, so I animated this guy on different programs. I did my other projects from the section on Flash, and I would still not use that program.
