        <h1> You're ok InDesign </h1>
        
<p>
    I think InDesign was an ok program, but I don't really see myself using it much. It was interesting making the postcard, but I wish I had more time with the program. If I had that time I could have made them better, maybe I could have improved the back design instead of it being simple. I think this was the final I didn't have fun making due to the complicated rules.
